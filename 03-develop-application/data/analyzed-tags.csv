"den bliver lidt fantastisk til sidst, n?r hun faktisk endelig m?der sin long lost love p? en bus. men som helhed er filmen lidt for langsommelig og flad i det synes jeg. hovedpersonen br?nder igennem og er meget smuk",1
cheadle appearance,1
den del af filmen hvor han bare g?r rundt og er fattig og stort set laver ingenting g?r godt nok utrolig meget i tomgang og bliver meget kedelig. Hvis man skal opleve hans kedsomhed og stillest?enhed s? er missionen mere end vellykket,1
